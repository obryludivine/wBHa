## Description

**wBHa** is an R package that implements a covariate multiple testing procedure specifically adapted in a Genome-Wide Association Studies context. wBHa allows better detection of rare variants (which where difficult to detect since the current existing procedures are not powerful enough) by better integrating external information while allowing the optimization of the overall power.

## Installation

You can install the released version of wBHa from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("wBHa")
```

It is also possible to install in-development versions from github.
``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("obryludivine/wBHa")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(wBHa)
## basic example code
```
